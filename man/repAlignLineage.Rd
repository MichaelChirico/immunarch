\title{This function aligns all sequences incliding germline within one clonal lineage. After building
clonal lineage and germline, the next step isto analyze the degree of mutation and maturity
of each clonal lineage. This allows you to find high mature cells and cells with a large number of offspring.
The phylogenetic analysis will find mutations that increase the affinity of BCR.
Making alignment of the sequence is the first step towards sequence analysis including BCR.}
\usage{
repAlignLineage(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data to be processed. Can be \link{data.frame}, \link{data.table}
or a list of these objects.

It must have columns in the immunarch compatible format \link{immunarch_data_format}, and also
must contain Sequence.germline column, which is added by repGermline() function.}
}
\value{
DNAbin object with alignment if there was single input dataframe,
or list of DNAbin objects if the input was a list of dataframes
}
