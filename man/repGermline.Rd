\title{This function creates germlines for clonal lineages. B cell clonal lineage represents a set of B cells
that presumably have a common origin (arising from the same VDJ rearrangement event) and a common ancestor.
Each clonal lineage has its own germline sequence that represents the ancestral sequence
for each BCR in clonal lineage. In other words, germline sequence is a sequence of B-cells immediately
after VDJ recombination, before B-cell maturation and hypermutation process. Germline sequence is useful
for assessing the degree of mutation and maturity of the repertoire.}
\usage{
repGermline(.data)

\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data to be processed. Can be \link{data.frame}, \link{data.table}
or a list of these objects.}

\item{species}{Species from which the data was acquired. Available options:
